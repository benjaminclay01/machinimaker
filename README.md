# machinimaker
A fake machinima program for a friend of mine. Built in QTCreator and compiled for Windows.

## How to use
1. After opening the application, click the single Page icon in the top left to open the message enqueue menu. 
2. Here, you can write a custom name and message, and select the color you wish the name to be. Press Accept once the settings are acceptable.
3. Press the Open Folder icon next to the Page icon to view enqueued messages.
4. The lower text box in the Dialog Box subwindow allows users to write a message and send it to the upper text box as a message from "You".
5. Press `Ctrl + N` to print the first enqueued message to the upper text box in the Dialog Box subwindow. If nothing is enqueued, nothing will print.
6. Press the Scissors icon to clear the upper Dialog Box text and Message queue.

## Notes
- The Debugger window allows users to type into it, but it has no other functionality
- The program currently does not allow users to remove individual eneuqued messages or edit enqueued messages.
  - This means that if an error or typo was written, the user will have to clear everything and start over.
